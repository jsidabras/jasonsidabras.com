	<p>So normally I don't make a list of things I want to accomplish every year, and every year I find myself wondering what to do next. This time, I'm going to give myself a list of goals. Some will be simple and repetitive, some will be long term. Either case, they will be here. I might add more as I think of them. 2014 is going to be a good, long year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use statistics and data to better track my life and find optimal goals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Work</strong>
Easiest one for me to hash out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish at least four (4) first name papers</li>
<li>Work towards translational research of my two patents</li>
<li>Take more time programming both Mathematica and FPGA</li>
<li>Work towards better management skills to increase employee productivity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Physical</strong>
I have been on and off the fitness train for many years (mostly off). With my upcoming wedding and other stresses creeping into my life, it is time to get a hold of an exercise routine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Work out at least three (3) times a week for at least 30 minutes</li>
<li>Work towards a fitness goal of 190 lbs, emphasizing cardio over total weight</li>
<li>Meditate five (5) times a week for at least 15 minutes. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hobby</strong>
I need to increase the leisure time in my life. Work has ruled the last 10 years, I need to find better balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>More fishing, try to get out at least once a month</li>
<li>More Golfing, learn better techniques</li>
<li>Put together an album of original music, at least 5 songs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programming</strong>
This should be under hobby, but I am making it stand alone. These are separate goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create at least one startup on the web that makes at least $100 a month</li>
<li>Create one game on the iOS platform</li>
<li>Create a 3d cellular automata program with input and output points that can be transferred to arduino</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personal</strong>
This is easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get married and enjoy an amazing honeymoon!</li>
<li>Read one non-work/school related book a month.</li>
</ul>
