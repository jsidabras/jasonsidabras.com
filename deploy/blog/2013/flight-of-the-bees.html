	<p>"<em>The time I kill is killing me.</em>" -Mason Cooley</p>
<p>Motivation. Seems to me that getting thoughts down for this blog are getting harder to work through. But I am not short of opinions, only the ability to take the time to articulate a full blog. So here is one of the subjects that have been bothering me:</p>
<h3>Who is killing all the bees?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/03/27/175278607/are-agricultures-most-popular-insecticides-killing-our-bees">It seems we might be</a>. </p>
<p>But it gets worse. Scientists estimate that <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-03/something-killing-half-americas-bees">1/3 of the bee population</a> has died this winter, and is consistent with the last 4 years. I read and hear of people talking about this, but I don't think everyone understands the gravity of this situation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Currently, the survivorship of honeybee colonies is too low for us to be confident in our ability to meet the pollination demands of U.S. agricultural crops,” the USDA report said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to be a case of science versus political policy (you will notice a theme). Some are concerned that the pesticide <em>neonicotinoids</em> is one of the leading causes of the declining bee population but there are dissenting opinions. Interestingly enough they are coming from the makers of the pesticide, <a href="http://consumerist.com/2012/04/26/monsanto-blamed-for-bee-population-collapse-so-it-buys-bee-research-firm/">Monsanto</a>.</p>
<p>Typically the name Monsanto evokes <em>boo, hiss</em> sounds when it is said out loud near drum circles, but the company seems to have every shady corporate practice rolled into one. In 2011, they purchased a large research entity that was finding causes for bee hive degradation, leading to some conclusions that Monsanto products were one of them. (This begs the question why such an entity would sell, better than being sued to oblivion.) Additionally with the newly signed "Monsanto Protection Act" (a provision snuck into an emergency budget bill), it allows free reign on genetically engineered crops which also might be affecting bee populations.</p>
<p>Before I get off topic and rant, let me hone in what direct connection genetically engineered crops have to do with bee colonies without assuming its in the pollen as some <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/wild-side-chicago/2013/03/are-monsanto-genetically-engineered-seeds-killing-off-honeybees/">European scientists have linked it</a>. <em>Stronger pesticides and herbicides</em>.</p>
<p>I am whole heartedly for genetically modified foods. They have the ability to bring nutritious foods to areas that have drought and famine. They can potentially make a simple potato have the essential vitamins for survival. They can help minimize the area needed to produce food for our growing world. And they can potentially curb <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/jan/15/climatechange-scienceofclimatechange">global warming</a>. Not to mention, maintain beer levels at their current BPC (beer per capita).</p>
<p>But the genetic modification of foods to remove their ability to reproduce and seed for monopolistic reasons, the hardening of natural foods against harsher and <em>harsher</em> chemicals needs to be regulated.</p>
<p>Monsanto probably employees the elite of chemists and genetic engineers. And with the practical monopoly on seed regulation and distribution they have the potential to change this world. If pesticides and genetically modified plants are causing any percentage of the bee decline, this trend will only become worse.</p>
