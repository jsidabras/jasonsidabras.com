    <h1>Rebooting my personal website</h1>

	<p>So it finally happened. I found the time to reboot <a href="http://jasonsidabras.com">jasonsidabras.com</a> and I figured I should take a bit of time and outline what I have done.</p>
<p>The first is the joy of static web-pages. When I started in HTML, JavaScript wasn't what it is now. There were no databases, and I sure didn't know any python. So I started with HTML and made some gaudy Geocities account. It was wonderful, and I think I got a total of 500 views. Or at least that is what my poorly customized counter would say on the bottom. </p>
<p>So when redesigning my personal web-space, I wanted the throwback of simple HTML. But the world has moved so far from that these days. So, to keep it all together I employed a little help from the static web-page generator <a href="https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde">Hyde</a>. It uses everything that I love about <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and puts it into a static hierarchy. And I write all of my blogs in Markdown, maintain changes of my code at <a href="https://github.com/cavillingelite">GitHub</a>. NOTE: no one should do anything without some kind of backup solution.</p>
<p>These days comment sections, either personally written, part of a WordPress site, or disqus only cause problems. You have to maintain a database, maintain users, and most importantly minimize spam. So like many other web-blogs, I have done away with them. If someone actually reads this and has comments I have an open <a href="http://twitter.com/cavilling_elite">twitter account</a> and Reddit is a great place to get the world to join or debate your viewpoint.</p>
<p>The background was from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle Patterns</a>. And the top is actually the gray-scaled inverse of the bottom. I also want to mention <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">font-awesome</a>. An amazing font created to give perfectly scaled icons for any web-page. All of the icons on this page are actually a font!</p>
<p>I spend a lot of time at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and I have read about the advantages of clean and clear fonts, adequate white-space, and the lack of using "pure black" for colors. I used the great Google fonts service to host "Roboto Condensed" and "Source Sans Pro". Both fonts seem highly compatible and are used in slightly different ways. Hopefully as I update this blog more, I will find a writing style. Until then, rambling will work.</p>
<p>My current reading list are the books that I am, well, currently reading. I use the <a href="http://refer.ly/">Referly</a> service to keep track of click-through and purchases made because of my links. In doing so, I might get a kickback if you purchase something on the end of those links. </p>
<p>I put these links up, because I am enjoying them, and I hope you do too. Same goes for the links of interest. I have started using <a href="http://refer.ly/am3U">Mindful Meditation</a> in order to calm stressful days. Human fMRI studies have shown a cumulative overall brain function health benefit when one practices meditation. I invite you to try it yourself. Finally, check out <a href="http://brawlerlit.com/">Brawler</a> for some short stories, comics, poetry, and other forms of media from the local Milwaukee area. </p>
<p>Let's end with the logo. I was trying to think of something nerdy but not circuits, or microwaves, or something obvious. I choose the electron shell diagram for silver. It is simple, can look eloquent, and Sidabras means silver in Lithuanian. Perfect fit.</p>
