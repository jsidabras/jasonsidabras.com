<p> I graduated from the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 2003 with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering Technology. Throughout my MSOE curriculum, I took independent study courses in electromagnetics and wireless design. In the summer of 2003 I found a home in the Department of Biophysics National Biomedical EPR Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. For 12 years, 2003-2015, I studied under Drs. James S. Hyde and Richard R. Mett who were indispensable mentors and with whom I share a number of publications. My publication record is filled with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) instrumentation, methodology, resonator probe design, site-directed spin labeling and other magnetic resonance scientific interests. I currently hold 2 U.S. Patents, have 22 peer-reviewed publications (four of which are first-name authorship), over 31 abstracts at EPR and MRI conferences, and 6 invited international talks. Google Scholar reports that I have over 229 citations of my work. </p>

<p>While I was a full-time research engineer at the Medical College of Wisconsin, I obtained a Master's of Science in Electrical Engineering (2005-2010) under the direction of Dr. James E. Richie, who specializes in analytical electromagnetics and numerical techniques. My Master's thesis included discourse on both numerical and analytical optimization on 100 kHz field modulation slots for use in EPR. A formal Green's function approach was taken to understand the physics of a modulation slot and to use directly to optimize the slot geometry for production of a uniform 100 kHz field modulation profile over the sample region.</p>

<p>As of March 2016, I have moved to Germany to pursue an exciting and prestigious career at the Max Planck for Chemical Energy Conversion under Drs. Edward J. Reijerse and Wolfgang Lubitz. At MPI-CEC I will lead the development of EPR resonator probe developments for the study of [FeFe]-hydrogenase protein single crystals. These single crystals are in the sub-nanoliter volume (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.5 mm typical geometries) and require novel resonator development to increase the EPR concentration sensitivity. Such resonator geometries will include micro-resonators with loops less than 500 micrometers in diameter and 244 GHz resonators with novel re-entrant geometries.</p>
