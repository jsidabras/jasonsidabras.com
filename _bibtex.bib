  abstract = {A reference arm W-band (94 GHz) microwave bridge with two sample-irradiation
	arms for saturation recovery (SR) EPR and ELDOR experiments is described.
	Frequencies in each arm are derived from 2 GHz synthesizers that
	have a common time-base and are translated to 94 GHz in steps of
	33 and 59 GHz. Intended applications are to nitroxide radical spin
	labels and spin probes in the liquid phase. An enabling technology
	is the use of a W-band loop-gap resonator (LGR) [J.W. Sidabras, R.R.
	Mett, W. Froncisz, T.G. Camenisch, J.R. Anderson, J.S. Hyde, Multipurpose
	EPR loop-gap resonator and cylindrical TE(011) cavity for aqueous
	samples at 94 GHz, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 78 (2007) 034701]. The high
	efficiency parameter (8.2 GW(-1/2) with sample) permits the saturating
	pump pulse level to be just 5 mW or less. Applications of SR EPR
	and ELDOR to the hydrophilic spin labels 3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetra-methyl-3-pyrroline-1-yloxyl
	(CTPO) and 2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidone-1-oxyl (TEMPONE) are
	described in detail. In the SR ELDOR experiment, nitrogen nuclear
	relaxation as well as Heisenberg exchange transfer saturation from
	pumped to observed hyperfine transitions. SR ELDOR was found to be
	an essential method for measurements of saturation transfer rates
	for small molecules such as TEMPONE. Free induction decay (FID) signals
	for small nitroxides at W-band are also reported. Results are compared
	with multifrequency measurements of T(1e) previously reported for
	these molecules in the range of 2-35 GHz [J.S. Hyde, J.-J. Yin, W.K.

	and strategic value for the emergency medical response to a large-scale
	radiological/nuclear event. One technique that has the potential
	for rapid and accurate dosimetry measurements is electron paramagnetic
	resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of relatively stable radiation-induced
	signals (RIS) in fingernails and toenails. Two approaches are being
	developed for EPR nail dosimetry. In the approach using ex vivo measurements
	on nail clippings, accurate estimation of the dose-dependent amplitude
	of the RIS is complicated by the presence of mechanically-induced
	signals (MIS) that are generated during the nail clipping. Recent
	developments in ex vivo nail dosimetry, including a thorough characterization
	of the MIS and an appreciation of the role of hydration and the development
	of effective analytic techniques, have led to improvements in the
	accuracy and precision of this approach. An in vivo nail dosimetry
	approach is also very promising, as it eliminates the problems of
	MIS from the clipping and it has the potential to be an effective
	and efficient approach for field deployment. Two types of EPR resonators
	are being developed for in vivo measurements of fingernails and toenails.},

	method based on analysis of the intense features of the electron
	paramagnetic resonance spectrum in the g( perpendicular) region at
	2 GHz is introduced to distinguish between three and four nitrogen
	ligands. The methodology was established by studies of a model system
	consisting of histidine imidazole ligation to Cu(2+). In this spectral
	region at 2 GHz (S-band), g-strain and broadening from the possible
	rhombic character of the Zeeman interaction are small. The most intense
	line is identified with the M(I) = +1/2 extra absorption peak. Spectral
	simulation demonstrated that this peak is insensitive to cupric A(x)
	and A(y) hyperfine interaction. The spectral region to the high-field
	side of this peak is uncluttered and suitable for analysis of nitrogen
	superhyperfine couplings to determine the number of nitrogens. The
	spectral region to the low-field side of the intense extra absorption
	peak in the g( perpendicular) part of the spectrum is sensitive to
	the rhombic distortion parameters A(x) and A(y). Application of the
	method to the prion protein system indicates that two species are
	present and that the dominant species contains four nitrogen ligands.
	A new loop-gap microwave resonator is described that contains approximately

	One output of a multiarm Q-band (35GHz) EPR bridge was translated
	to W-band for sample irradiation by mixing with 59 GHz; similarly,
	the EPR signal was translated back to Q-band for detection. A cavity
	resonant in the cylindrical TE011 mode suitable for use with 100
	kHz field modulation has also been developed. Results using microwave
	frequency modulation (FM) at 50 kHz as an alternative to magnetic
	field modulation are described. FM was accomplished by modulating
	a varactor coupled to the 59 GHz oscillator. A spin-label study of
	sensitivity was performed under conditions of overmodulation and
	gamma2H1(2)T1T2<1. EPR spectra were obtained, both absorption and
	dispersion, by lock-in detection at the fundamental modulation frequency
	(50 kHz), and also at the second and third harmonics (100 and 150
	kHz). Source noise was deleterious in first harmonic spectra, but
	was very low in second and third harmonic spectra. First harmonic
	microwave FM was transferred to microwave modulation at second and
	third harmonics by the spins, thus satisfying the "transfer of modulation"
	principle. The loaded Q-value of the LGR with sample was 90 (i.e.,
	a bandwidth between 3 dB points of about 1 GHz), the resonator efficiency
	parameter was calculated to be 9.3 G at one W incident power, and
	the frequency deviation was 11.3 MHz p-p, which is equivalent to
	a field modulation amplitude of 4 G. W-band EPR using an LGR is a
	favorable configuration for microwave FM experiments.},

  abstract = {A continuous wave (CW) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum
	is typically displayed as the first harmonic response to the application
	of 100 kHz magnetic field modulation, which is used to enhance sensitivity
	by reducing the level of 1/f noise. However, magnetic field modulation
	of any amplitude causes spectral broadening and sacrifices EPR spectral
	intensity by at least a factor of two. In the work presented here,
	a CW rapid-scan spectroscopic technique that avoids these compromises
	and also provides a means of avoiding 1/f noise is developed. This
	technique, termed non-adiabatic rapid sweep (NARS) EPR, consists
	of repetitively sweeping the polarizing magnetic field in a linear
	manner over a spectral fragment with a small coil at a repetition
	rate that is sufficiently high that receiver noise, microwave phase
	noise, and environmental microphonics, each of which has 1/f characteristics,
	are overcome. Nevertheless, the rate of sweep is sufficiently slow
	that adiabatic responses are avoided and the spin system is always
	close to thermal equilibrium. The repetitively acquired spectra from
	the spectral fragment are averaged. Under these conditions, undistorted
	pure absorption spectra are obtained without broadening or loss of
	signal intensity. A digital filter such as a moving average is applied
	to remove high frequency noise, which is approximately equivalent
	in bandwidth to use of an integrating time constant in conventional
	field modulation with lock-in detection. Nitroxide spectra at L-
	and X-band are presented.},

	The waveguide has an oversize section of commercially available rectangular

	connect conventional rectangular WR10 waveguide to the WR28. For

	flare (inflection point) in the taper was optimized with respect
	to the coupling to higher order modes and the reflection of the main
	mode. The optimum inflection point position is about one-tenth of
	the taper length from the small end of the taper. Reflection and
	coupling were reduced by about 20 dB relative to a pyramidal (linear)
	taper of the same length. Comb-like dips in the transmission coefficient
	produced by resonances of the higher order modes in the oversize

  abstract = {The coupled system of the microwave cylindrical TE(011) cavity and
	the TE(01delta) dielectric modes has been analyzed in order to determine
	the maximum achievable resonator efficiency parameter of a dielectric
	inserted into a cavity, and whether this value can exceed that of
	a dedicated TE(01delta) mode dielectric resonator. The frequency,
	Q value, and resonator efficiency parameter Lambda for each mode
	of the coupled system were calculated as the size of the dielectric
	was varied. Other output parameters include the relative field magnitudes
	and phases. Two modes are found: one with fields in the dielectric
	parallel to the fields in the cavity center and the other with antiparallel
	fields. Results closely match those from a computer program that
	solves Maxwell's equations by finite element methods. Depending on
	the relative natural resonance frequencies of the cavity and dielectric,
	one mode has a higher Q value and correspondingly lower Lambda than
	the other. The mode with the higher Q value is preferentially excited
	by a coupling iris or loop in or near the cavity wall. However, depending
	on the frequency separation between modes, either can be excited
	in this way. A relatively narrow optimum is found for the size of
	the insert that produces maximum signal for both modes simultaneously.
	It occurs when the self-resonance frequencies of the two resonators
	are nearly equal. The maximum signal is almost the same as that of
	the dedicated TE(01delta) mode dielectric resonator alone, Lambda
	congruent with40 G/W(1/2) at X-band for a KTaO(3) crystal. The cavity
	is analogous to the second stage of a two-stage coupler. In general,
	there is no electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal benefit
	by use of a second stage. However, there is a benefit of convenience.
	A properly designed sample-mounted resonator inserted into a cavity
	can give EPR signals as large as what one would expect from the dielectric
	resonator alone.},

  abstract = {An analytic circuit model for slot coupling from a waveguide to a
	loop-gap resonator (LGR) in a context of electron paramagnetic resonance
	(EPR) spectroscopy is presented. The physical dimensions of the waveguide,
	iris, LGR, and aqueous sample are transformed into circuit values
	of inductance, capacitance, and resistance. These values are used
	in a solution of circuit equations that results in a prediction of
	the rf currents, magnitude and phase, frequency, and magnetic and
	electric stored energies near critical coupling. The circuit geometry
	reflects magnetic flux conservation between the iris and LGR as well
	as modification of the outer loop LGR currents by the iris. Unlike
	conventional models, coupling is not explicitly based on a mutual
	inductance between the iris and LGR. Instead, the conducting wall
	high frequency rf boundary condition is used to define surface currents,
	regions, and circuit topology with lumped-circuit values of self-inductance,
	capacitance, and resistance. Match is produced by a combination of
	self-inductive and capacitive circuit coupling. Two conditions must
	be met to achieve match. First, the equivalent resistance of the
	LGR as seen by the iris must be transformed into the waveguide characteristic
	impedance. This transformation is met at a particular frequency relative
	to the natural LGR resonance frequency. The frequency shift magnitude
	is largely determined by the LGR properties, weakly dependent on
	iris length and placement, and independent of other iris dimensions.
	The second condition for match is that the iris reactance at this
	frequency shift must cancel the residual reactance of the LGR. This
	second condition is sensitive to the iris dimensions. If both conditions
	are not simultaneously satisfied, overcoupling or undercoupling results.
	A slotted iris of equal length to the size of the large dimension
	of the waveguide is found to have many properties opposite to a conventional
	iris of shorter length. Notably, the magnetic field near the iris
	tends to reinforce rather than oppose the magnetic field in the resonator.
	The long iris improves the LGR EPR performance by providing increased
	rf magnetic field homogeneity at the sample, higher signal, and reduced
	total frequency shift since the shifts due to sample and iris tend
	to cancel. Investigations reveal that the first match condition can
	be adjusted by LGR dimensional changes and such adjustment can eliminate
	the frequency shift. Results are consistent with Ansoft High Frequency
	Structure Simulator (Version 10.1, Ansoft Corporation, Pittsburgh,
	PA) simulations and can be extended to cavity resonators.},

  abstract = {This paper builds on the work of Mett and Hyde [J. Magn. Reson. 165
	(2003) 137]. Various aqueous flat-cell geometries in the perpendicular
	orientation have been studied using Ansoft High Frequency Structure
	Simulator (version 9.0, Pittsburgh, PA) and Computer Simulation Technology
	Microwave Studio (version 5.0, Wellesley Hills, MA). The analytic
	theory of Mett and Hyde has been refined to predict optimum dimensions
	of multiple sample cell structures including the effect of the sample
	holder dielectric properties and the interaction of the cells with
	each other on EPR signal strength. From these calculations and simulations
	we propose a practical multiple cell sample structure for use in
	commercial rectangular TE102 cavities that yields 2.0-2.3 times higher
	sensitivity relative to a single flat-cell in the nodal orientation.
	We also describe a modified TE102 resonator design with square rather
	than cylindrical sample-access stacks that is predicted to give a
	factor of 2.2-2.7 enhancement in EPR signal strength of a single
	flat-cell in the nodal orientation. These signal enhancements are
	predicted with sample holders fabricated from polytetrafluoroethylene.
	Additional improvement in EPR signal of up to 75\% can be achieved
	by using sample holder materials with lower dielectric constants.},

  abstract = {With possibilities for radiation terrorism and intensified concerns
	about nuclear accidents since the recent Fukushima Daiichi event,
	the potential exposure of large numbers of individuals to radiation
	that could lead to acute clinical effects has become a major concern.
	For the medical community to cope with such an event and avoid overwhelming
	the medical care system, it is essential to identify not only individuals
	who have received clinically significant exposures and need medical
	intervention but also those who do not need treatment. The ability
	of electron paramagnetic resonance to measure radiation-induced paramagnetic
	species, which persist in certain tissues (e.g., teeth, fingernails,
	toenails, bone, and hair), has led to this technique becoming a prominent
	method for screening significantly exposed individuals. Although
	the technical requirements needed to develop this method for effective
	application in a radiation event are daunting, remarkable progress
	has been made. In collaboration with General Electric and through
	funding committed by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development
	Authority, electron paramagnetic resonance tooth dosimetry of the
	upper incisors is being developed to become a Food and Drug Administration-approved
	and manufacturable device designed to carry out triage for a threshold
	dose of 2 Gy. Significant progress has also been made in the development
	of electron paramagnetic resonance nail dosimetry based on measurements
	of nails in situ under point-of-care conditions, and in the near
	future this may become a second field-ready technique. Based on recent
	progress in measurements of nail clippings, it is anticipated that
	this technique may be implementable at remotely located laboratories
	to provide additional information when the measurements of dose on-site
	need to be supplemented. The authors conclude that electron paramagnetic
	resonance dosimetry is likely to be a useful part of triage for a
	large-scale radiation incident.},
